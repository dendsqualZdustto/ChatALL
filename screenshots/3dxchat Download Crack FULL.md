Edilclima was founded in 1989 by a group of engineers and architects who wanted to create innovative software for the construction sector. Since then, the company has grown to become one of the leading providers of software solutions in Italy and abroad, with more than 100,000 customers and 300 distributors. Edilclima's mission is to offer high-quality software that meets the needs and expectations of professionals and institutions in the field of building design, construction and management.
  
One of the main features of Edilclima software is that they are constantly updated to comply with the latest regulations and standards in the industry. For example, Edilclima EC700 is based on the UNI/TS 11300 technical specifications for energy certification of buildings, which are aligned with the European directives on energy performance of buildings. Edilclima software also integrates with other popular software platforms such as AutoCAD, Revit, SketchUp and Excel, allowing users to import and export data and drawings easily and accurately.

Edilclima software also provides users with extensive documentation and tutorials, as well as online and offline technical support. Moreover, Edilclima software allows users to customize their projects according to their preferences and needs, with a wide range of options and parameters to choose from.
  
Edilclima software is not only designed for professionals, but also for students and teachers who want to learn and teach the principles and techniques of building design and energy efficiency. Edilclima offers special discounts and licenses for educational institutions and organizes training courses and seminars for teachers and students. Edilclima also collaborates with universities and research centers to develop new software solutions and improve existing ones.
  
Edilclima software is also suitable for public administrations and agencies that are responsible for the regulation and control of the construction sector. Edilclima software can help them to verify the compliance of building projects with the current norms and standards, as well as to monitor and evaluate the energy performance of existing buildings. Edilclima software can also assist them in planning and implementing policies and strategies for improving the energy efficiency and sustainability of the built environment.
  
Edilclima software is therefore a valuable tool for anyone who is involved or interested in the construction industry, whether as a professional, a student, a teacher, a public official or a citizen.
